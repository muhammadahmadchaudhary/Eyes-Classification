## Eye Classification Project

This project implements an eye classification model using a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques. The pipeline begins with loading and preprocessing a dataset of eye images, where images are resized, normalized, and labeled for training. The project explores different models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to classify the images based on their features. The models are trained and evaluated using accuracy metrics, classification reports, and confusion matrices to ensure their effectiveness. Key libraries used include TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, and OpenCV, enabling a comprehensive approach to image classification.
